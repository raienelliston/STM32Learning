# STM32Learning
My small projects that were created during my proccess of learning STM32 on the Nucleo64-F446RE development board

## Overview
These projects are my first experience programming and using embedded microcontrollers and the STM32 chip series. This learning isn't tied to any course and is instead my own path of learning embedded programming, taking in consideration my own knowladge of microcontrollers, circuits, and programming. 

## Hardware Used
All projects use the Nucleo64-F446RE development board

## Projects

### LearningProject1 - "Hello World" with STMCubeIDE
Downloaded only STMCubeIDE and setup a new project. Learned how to configure the pins on the chip and generate code for them using the IDE. Codded the green LED to respond to when the B1 button is pressed.
